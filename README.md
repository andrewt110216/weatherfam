# WeatherFam
A web-based weather app focused on people instead of zip codes, built on Django.

## Introduction

A web app that allows you to track the weather for everyone in your "WeatherFam": friends and family members living anywhere in the world.

On your home page, you can see the current and upcoming weather for all members of your WeatherFam in one place! No more scrolling through pages of saved cities and towns to find our what's happening where your loved ones are--find it all in one clean and personalized view, with the option to add a picture and change the location for each member of your WeatherFam.

## Purpose

After many months of dedicated studying and working on some smaller projects, WeatherFam represents my first large project; an attempt to apply all that I've learned so far to something interesting and useful, and to push myself to learn a lot more about managing a production application.

I had my Mom in mind as I came up with the idea for this app. A mother of four sons that are now spread across the country (Maryland, New York, Illinois, and California), she always wants to know what kind of weather we're experiencing, so she knows we are safe and happy. Most weather apps are focused on seeing the forecast for one place at a time and providing every weather data point imaginable for that place; my goal was to bring only the pertinent information my Mom would want (temperature and weather events) into one easy-to-look-at view.
